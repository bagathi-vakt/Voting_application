# Sample Hardhat Project

<!--
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. -->

To setup

```
    npx hardhat node
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

    set Votingaddress in app.js with the contract address

    npm start
```

Try running some of the following tasks:

<!-- ```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
``` -->
